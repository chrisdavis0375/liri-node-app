Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface

*What LIRI does

-LIRI is closely related to SIRI except instead of interpretating speach LIRI interprets language. LIRI accepts four different commands from the user(spotify-this-song, movie-this, concert-this, do-what-it-says). spotify-this-song generates a list different songs, artists, albums, and when they were released. movie-this brings up the movie searched with the title of the movie, the plot, imdb rating, and the year it was released. concert-this returns a list of upcoming concerts, the venues they're located at, date of event, and the artists performing. do-what-it-says will run the logic that is used when spotify-this-song is executed and will return results for "The Sign".

*How LIRI is useful

-LIRI is useful for getting information about anything related to songs or movies, and finding a concert thats being performed by one of your favorite artists or bands.

*How to execute commands with LIRI

-Start by typing into your console node liri.js followed by one of four commands. Ex: node liri.js spotify-this-song.

-Then after the command, input your search query. Ex: node liri.js movie-this The Matrix.

-If everything is entered correctly LIRI will return your search results based off of the command and search query.

-If nothing is searched after executing command spoify-this-song, the search query will default to "The Sign". If nothing is searched after executing movie-this, the search query will default to "Mr.Nobody".
